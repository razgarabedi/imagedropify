# **App Name**: ImageDrop

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Accepts image uploads with a file size limit of 10MB and supports all standard image formats such as JPG, PNG, GIF, and WebP.
- Image Preview: Provides a real-time preview of the uploaded image.
- Image URL Generation: Generates a direct URL for each uploaded image for easy sharing. URLs must be short and easy to share, but they do not need to be unique. Use a URL shortening tool if necessary.
- Responsive Layout: Uses a responsive design framework (like NextUI) to ensure the website adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neutral white or light gray for a clean background.
- Secondary color: Soft gray for text and borders to ensure readability.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for upload buttons and interactive elements.
- Clean, centered layout with sufficient spacing. Use a single-column layout for mobile and a multi-column layout for larger screens.
- Simple, outlined icons for actions like 'upload' and 'copy URL'.
- Subtle fade-in effects for image previews and loading indicators for uploads.
